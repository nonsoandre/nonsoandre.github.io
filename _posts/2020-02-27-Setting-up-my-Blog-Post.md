Setting up my blog was an interesting adventure for me.After creating so many mock-up codes which only I can access on my local host, I decided it was high time to do something real. Where else to start than creating a blog site, my own blog site. As a begginer in front-end development, this was not going to be an easy fit. The thing I was most worried about was how I was going to manage the site content. Wordpress or its like was a no-go for me. I thought my site was too small, and too static for some overbloated CMS. I hadn't heard of static generators before, or maybe I had come across them but it used to be my nature to just pass by when all these tech buzz words are mentioned - I had not gotten a full comprehension of Javascript and CSS and I wasn't ready to add another headache to my already existing headache. I decided then to reach out to one of my online teachers and mentor, [Kevin Powell](http://www.kevinpowell.co), who adviced me to use Jekyll. WTH is Jekyll? A static site generator. What is a static site generator - SSG? From here my adventure began.

### GETTING A DESIGN FOR MY BLOG
There are a lot of blog design and themes online that your biggest challenge will be choosing one. The top theme markets are [envato](http://www.elements.envato.com/themes), [wordpress themes](http://www.wordpress.org/themes/), [themeforest](http://www.themeorest.net), [just free themes](http://www.justfreethemes.com/themes) and [themeisle](www.themeisle.com). I also checked out [jekyll themes](http://www.jekyllthemes.io), and there were pretty amazing ones there. However I wanted to code my blog up from scratch so I downloaded picture formats of my design that I had chosen. ONe of the things I looked for most in my design was minmalism such that readers can solely focus on the content. 
From scratch I developed an ADOBE XD prototype of the design I picked. Developing a prtotype makes coding very easy. You wouldn't want to be thinking about font-sizes, colours and layout format while you are coding. In developing a prototype, this is where you get to do all these design things. I don't think there is any FED in the world that dont know the importance of having a little design skill whether you are using Adobe XD, Figma, Photoshop, Sketch or others. A protoype dont just allow you to see what you want to code, it makes availble for your code important assets that you will use everywhere on your site.


### CODING UP MY BLOG
This is the aspect I love the most, getting up, close and personal with the code. I used a day developimg the important pages including the index, post roll and the post pages. What I learnt from this experience is how you can never know everything. Sometimes due to collapsed margin or under padding or some weird css property your page kind of produce an awkward behaviour and you digging for where the problem comes from or a solution. Whenever I come across such scenarios  I try to keep my ead down and be patient enough to learn what the problem is. This is very important so that you can learn how to solve same problem incase you encounter it again. 

### USING JEKYLL
Setting up jekyll was easy with the help of [Thomas Bradley](http://www.learn-the-web.algoquindesign.ca/topics/jekyll) youtube video. His Jekyll tutorial is the best you can get out there on youtube. Jekyll is amongst the oldest static site generator and is even used by github. Using jekyll, I have been able to learn about two more languages, Liquid language and Markdown language. Learning new stuff is the beauty of web and software development.

Finally, I am glad to have got off my feet to begin this blog. If you are a developer and you haven't got one, better get up from your chair and go start one now.
