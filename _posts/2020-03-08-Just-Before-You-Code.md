Before one dives into learning programming language, there are certain pre-requistes that is needed. But as a self-taught/self-teaching programmer, where there are no known ready curricular, you are most highly guaranteed to skip phases. There is one phase you are most likely to skip and that is what I am here to talk about today.

Programming languages are unlike HTML or CSS. While HTML and CSS  is basically a WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET(WYSIWYG) language, which means anything you give the computer is what you get back in the console, in this case the browser. However in a program there has to be logic. Its not enough to learn syntax and then give it a rest. If it doesn't make sense, you program is not going to work accordingly. 

By the time you start dealing with bugs, the whole thing starts messing with your head. This is where the frustration begins to set in. At this point you begin to habour thoughts of giving up. Some people loose confidence and starts to rely on completing tutorials after tutorials, while inside they are so scared to journey on their own. In my case, i jumped from one programming language to another. In 4 months, I had completed tutorials on Java, Python and PHP but when you handed me a blank page to solve a problem, you know that thing you do when you sit for an exam paper that you never even attended the lectures or read a note, yeah, Istare hard at the empty screen.

### HOW TO OVERCOME 
Have you found yourself in any of these scenarios? Well there is only one explanation for this, You skipped an Algorithm class. My point being that you find it difficult in solving problems programatically speaking. Many programming books give mentionto pseudo-codes, algoriths etc but that is all it is, a mention. Few books are dedicated on how to solve problems. And the ones you find looks like they are written for computers.

Programming is problem solving. The most important thing about a program is the algorithm or pseudo-codes. Diving straight into any program without one is like skydiving without parachute. You program is going to crash.

Problem solving is all about breaking down a major problem into bits and solving each bit individually and then putting them back together to solve the major problem. There is way more to problem solving than it sounds. But once mastered, learning a programming language becomes only a matter of learning its syntax.

A lot of experienced programmers have indicated a lack of problem solving skill as one of the major reasons why people face difficulties in learning programming and doing something with it. Myself actually has gone through these challenges and am out of it. Now not knowing everything dont hurt my confidence neither does a bug. I face my problems.

To help overcome, read Zell Liew's [article](https://zellwk.com/blog/think) on how to think like a programmer and make sure to subscribe for his mails. Zell has a way of putting you at ease with learning. If you are looking for a book then I recommend Paul Vickers ['How to think  like a programmer: Problem solving for the bewildered'](https://amazon.com/How-to-think-like-a-programmer-Bewildered/dp/1408065827).


You shall overcome and you don't need to go to Mountain on Fire for that to happen.
