Visit GitHub.com and click on the “Sign up” button on the upper right. Write your desired username. This will be visible to others, identify you on GitHub, and also be part of your site’s URL; for example, the author’s GitHub username is amandavisconti and her demo Jekyll site’s URL is http://amandavisconti.github.io/JekyllDemo/. (Note you can also purchase your own domain name and use it for this site, but that won’t be covered in this tutorial). Also write your desired email address and password, then click “Create an account”.
On the next page, click the “Choose” button next to the “Free” plan option, ignore the “Help me set up an organization next” checkbox, and click “Finish sign up”.
Optional: Visit https://github.com/settings/profile to add a full name (can be your real name, GitHub user name, or something else) and other public profile information, if desired.
GitHub Desktop app
The GitHub Desktop app will make updating your live website (one we set it up) easy—instead of using the command line every time you want to update your site, you’ll be able to use an easier visual tool to update your site.

Visit the GitHub Desktop site and click on the “Download GitHub Desktop” button to download the GitHub Desktop software to your computer (Mac and Windows only; Linux users will need to use git just via the command line, which is not covered in this version of the tutorial).
Once the file has completely downloaded, double-click on it and use the following directions to install GitHub Desktop…
Enter the username and password for the GitHub.com account you created using the steps above. (Ignore the “Add an Enterprise Account” button.) Click “Continue”.
Enter the name and email address you want the work on your site to be associated with (probably just your public name and work email address, but it’s up to you!).
On the same page, click the “Install Command Line Tools” button and enter your computer’s username and password if prompted (then click the “Install Helper” button on the prompt). After you get a popup message that all command line tools have successfully installed, click continue.
The last page will ask “Which repositories would you like to use?”. Ignore this and click the “Done” button.
Optional: Follow the walkthrough of the GitHub Desktop app that will appear (this isn’t necessary; we will cover anything you need to do with GitHub in this lesson).
