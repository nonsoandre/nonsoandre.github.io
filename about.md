## Hello There, I am Nonso Andre
Glad to have you in my little space online. It means so much to me that you came around to share in what I have out here. I am an aspiring web developer and currently going through the journey of becoming a professional in this field.

## A Quick Bio of My Web Dev Carrer
I am a self-taught aspiring web developer who hails from Nigeria and studied Management and Computer Studies in Wisconsin International University College, Accra, Ghana. 

I got eloped in the world of the web when I was in the university after getting tired of computer game, especially football manager. I decided to understand how computers and everything that happens behind my LCD laptop screen works. 

From then on there has been an ever present flame to keep learning and never give up. Yes hat last sentence has to do with the fact that I am not naturally a computer geek and have struggled a hell lot. But my passion has been enough to keep me afloat and small small am climbing the mountain hoping I reach my peak. 

## What My blog hopes to achieve
The goal of my blog is to express in my own view what I have learnt and how I have solved my challenges in the simplest words possible for every programming begginer out there.
Never be daunted when you get stuck. Every programmer out there have struggled, most still do and I am no exception. But you know what, you know what, you never know how far you can go when you dont stop.
